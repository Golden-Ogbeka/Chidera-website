    nice one.now before we start our egg roll making we need our ingredients, we have our igredients down there.that is for that
   </p> 
    <h2>ingredients</h2> <p>then for your ingredients you have</p>
    <!--list-->
    <ul>css</ul>
    <ul>flour</ul>
    <ul>nutmeg</ul>
    <ul>surgar</ul>
    <ul>salt</ul>
    <ul>butter</ul>
    <ul>egg</ul>
    <ul>vegitable oil</ul>
    <ul>milk powder</ul>
    <p>
        then after you have goten your ingredients what remains is the preparation.then for that you first put your egg on fire and let it boil for fifteen minuts. then put it inside cold water for easy pell. then get a bowl and put your flour inside a bowl and add your nutmeg,baking powder,salt,surgar,milk powder and lastly your butter then add small water and mix well until it is smooth. when that is ready start pressing your doll to be flat. when your doll is flat,then put one egg on the flat doll and then start closing it. when you are done with that put it inside a bowl.then put your oil on fire until it is hot.then start puting your doll inside it until it is brown before you bring it out like picture up there.GOOD LUCK.
